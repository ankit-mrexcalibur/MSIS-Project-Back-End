About MSIS:-
A web application that identifies medical speciality based on medical transcription data. MSIS is an automation solution to replace the manual human intervention for booking appointment with a medical specialist. We used NLP techniques for processing the unstructured medical data and applying supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the medical specialty.
This application is currently capable to predicting follow medical specialities:
1. Cardiovascular/Pulmonary
2. General Medicine
3. Surgery
4. Radiology
5. Orthopedic
6. Consult - History and Physician

This MSIS application has a frontend written in Node.js
